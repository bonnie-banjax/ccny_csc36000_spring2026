**Course description**
An overview of modern distributed computing. Students develop an understanding of basic models of networking, parallel, and distributed computing technologies and learn fundamentals of networking components and their applications.

## Purpose of this REPO

The purpose of this repository is for the instructor to share code with the entire class.  Students will not be able to push (write) to this repo unless specifically requested by instructor.  Students will be able to clone or pull (read) from this repository only

## Group Projects

1. In the **1st week**, instructor will create groups of 4 or 5 by randomly adding students to the group.
2. Each group must choose a team lead every week who will be in charge their own repo.
3. The team lead for week 1 is responsible for create a new private REPO for the group and granting the instructor and all members of the group read and write access to the REPO.  The instructor's email is kbrown6@ccny.cuny.edu
4. Each student must write all their code on their [own branch](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/branch-a-repository/) in the REPO.  Your branch name should be the email alias.  For example, if your email is kbrown6@ccny.cuny.edu, your branch name should be kbrown6.  Your branch should be created from the main branch.
5. Individual and group coding assignments will be submitted to your branch which will show clearly your contributions
6. For group projects, you will create a branch with your email alias and the feature you are assigned to implement.  For example, if the feature is "Implement Counter for each node", your branch could be kbrown/implement_counter.  Each student must create a pull request to merge their feature to the main branch.  The team lead for the week is responsible for apporving the pull request to merge the code.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
